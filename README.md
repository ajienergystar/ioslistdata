This iOS application is developed using SwiftUI for building responsive and modern user interfaces. Networking tasks such as fetching and sending data to a RESTful API are handled using Alamofire, a powerful and easy-to-use HTTP networking library. By combining SwiftUI and Alamofire, the app ensures smooth UI updates based on real-time data and provides a clean architecture for managing API calls, error handling, and data parsing.
